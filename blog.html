    <h1>Discover the Heart of the Cordillera: Bontoc</h1>
    <p>Bontoc, my home, is a place like no other. Nestled in the mountains of the Cordillera, this vibrant town is the capital of Mountain Province and a treasure trove of culture, heritage, and natural beauty. With every sunrise that kisses the rice terraces and every echo of gongs during festivals, I am reminded of why I am proud to be from this land.</p>

    <h2>Living Culture and Tradition</h2>
    <p>Our identity is deeply rooted in our traditions. From the traditional dormitories known as <em>ato</em> and <em>olog</em> to the intricate backstrap weaving in Samoki, Bontoc keeps our cultural flame burning bright. We celebrate our kinship and history through dances, stories, and rituals that have been passed down through generations.</p>

    <h2>Places That Tell Our Story</h2>
    <p>The Bontoc Museum offers a window into our past. Here, tribal artifacts and replicas of native houses help us understand our people’s way of life. A short trip away, the Alab Petroglyphs and Stone Calendar reveal that our ancestors were astronomers and artists thousands of years ago.</p>

    <h2>The Land That Nourishes</h2>
    <p>Our rice terraces, carved into the mountains of Maligcong, Bayyo, and Guina-ang, are more than agricultural feats — they are sacred, sustainable, and stunning. These terraces represent our bond with the earth and the values of patience and cooperation. The natural hot springs in Mainit and the untouched waterfalls are places I go to when I need peace and healing.</p>

    <h2>Festivals That Unite Us</h2>
    <p>Every September, we gather for the Am-among Festival. Dressed in vibrant woven garments, we dance to the rhythm of gongs and celebrate our unity. It’s a time to honor our elders, our customs, and the spirit that binds us all together as i-Bontoc.</p>

    <h2>Growing With the Land</h2>
    <p>Education is growing here too. Mountain Province State University provides opportunities for young people to grow, while still being grounded in our identity. Whether on the winding roads of Halsema Highway or on the trail to a hidden waterfall, there is always something new to discover and appreciate about Bontoc.</p>
