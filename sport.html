    <h1>My Love for Basketball</h1>
    <p>Basketball has always been more than just a sport to me—it's a passion, a way to stay active, and a space where I feel truly alive. Every time I step on the court, whether it’s a street game with friends or a local tournament, I feel the rush of energy and joy.</p>

    <p>I started playing basketball when I was young, dribbling around on a rough court with makeshift hoops. From there, I grew more confident with my skills—shooting, passing, rebounding—and I fell in love with the fast pace and team spirit that basketball brings.</p>

    <h2>Why Basketball?</h2>
    <p>Basketball isn't just about scoring. It's about communication, reading the game, and pushing yourself every single play. I love how it challenges both the body and the mind. It teaches discipline, respect, and resilience—traits that I carry with me even off the court.</p>

    <p>Whether I'm shooting hoops solo to clear my head or competing with teammates in a tight match, basketball has been a constant in my life. It's more than a hobby—it's a part of who I am.</p>

    <h2>Where I Play</h2>
    <p>I usually play in our local barangay court here in Bontoc, and sometimes in nearby schools or sports events. Win or lose, the adrenaline and camaraderie always make it worthwhile. I also follow the NBA and admire players who inspire me with their dedication and skill.</p>

    <p>As long as I can run, jump, and shoot, I know basketball will always have a place in my heart.</p>
